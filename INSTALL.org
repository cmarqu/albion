* Installing

Some quick notes I took while installing albion on a new system.

** Global install

- pick a global location to keep albion.py, albion_profile, and albionrc (they can all go in the same place)

- pick a global location to keep albion configs (probably not the same place as the above files)

- pick a global location to keep albion envs (not the exact same place as albion configs, but close by is usually helpful)

- create a default env in the envs global location (it can just be an empty file to get started)

- edit albion_profile to set ALBION_ENVS_PATH, ALBION_CONFIGS_PATH, PATH_TO_ALBION, and DEFAULT_ENV.

** Local user install

- remove or rename =~/.bash_profile=

- add a line to source albion_profile at the *beginning* of =~/.profile=

- add a line to source albionrc at the *end* of =~/.bashrc=

- If you don't want your default env to be default, put this at the top of your =~/.profile=, before you source albion_profile:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
if [ -z "$ALBION_ENV" ]; then
    export ALBION_ENV="env-name"
fi
#+END_SRC

where env-name is the environment you want to start with when you log in.
