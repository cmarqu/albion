Strive to work with any POSIX shell:

This means bash, korn shell, and zshell should all work.  Non-POSIX shells like csh and tcsh very likely won't.

Does require Python.

loads and unloads configs

should there be staging of configs for future loading?  might be a premature optimization.

configs can issue albion commands to load other configs, but, should there be a notion of something that is a collection of configs?  maybe that's an environment.  an environment is made up of configurations?  I kind of like that.  Hmm, you can load multiple configs, can you load multiple environments?  I think maybe not.

should there be roles?  (they could be used in an environment to conditionally load certain configs for people with different roles)  they could be added later, I think.

load a config:  source a config file, record what has been sourced
load an env: source an env file, which will likely have load config commands, record env that is loaded.
unload a config: remove config from list of loaded configs, purgeenv and reload env
load an env: replace recorded env with this new one, purgeenv and reload env

Variables:
ALBION_CONFIG_PATH: like PATH, a list of paths to albion config files
ALBION_ENV_PATH: like PATH, a list of paths to albion environment files
ALBION_ENV: currently loaded env
ALBION_CONFIGS: list of currently loaded configs

will we replace .profile and shell rc files, or source something at the top of them that loads albion stuff?
