* KEEPERS env variable (need a name for this tool to prepend to it)
   where a user can list their own env vars that purgenev won't unset

* work out workflow of loading and unloading envs and configs

* eval or not eval:  some of the albion commands will output strings
   that need to be fed to eval, some of the albion commands will just
   print informational strings.  How to work this?

* list_envs command should be list envs (so that other lists will
   work, like list configs, or list loaded envs, and stuff like that.

* list commands will need to format output in nice columns when the
   list is long.
