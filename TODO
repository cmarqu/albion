* KEEPERS env variable (need a name for this tool to prepend to it)
   where a user can list their own env vars that purgenev won't unset

* work out workflow of loading and unloading envs and configs: there
   will need to be something probably in .profile that loads all
   the configs in ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS.  An unload will be, remove
   the config from ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS, purge everything, and then
   let the .profile rebuild, including loading configs that are in
   ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS.

* relatedly, will unload command unload a config loaded by the env?
   If the thing in .profile just loads the env, then the answer is no,
   if it just loads whatever is currently in ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS,
   then how will an env get loaded when you log in?

* eval or not eval:  some of the albion commands will output strings
   that need to be fed to eval, some of the albion commands will just
   print informational strings.  How to work this?  So far I'm just
   output non-evaled stuff to STDERR

* list_envs command should be list envs (so that other lists will
   work, like list configs, or list loaded envs, and stuff like that.

* list commands will need to format output in nice columns when the
   list is long.
