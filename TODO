* KEEPERS env variable (need a name for this tool to prepend to it)
   where a user can list their own env vars that purgenev won't unset

* work out workflow of loading and unloading envs and configs: there
   will need to be something probably in .profile that loads all
   the configs in ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS.  An unload will be, remove
   the config from ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS, purge everything, and then
   let the .profile rebuild, including loading configs that are in
   ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS.

* relatedly, will unload command unload a config loaded by the env?
   If the thing in .profile just loads the env, then the answer is no,
   if it just loads whatever is currently in ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS,
   then how will an env get loaded when you log in?

* relatedly, it all depends on how the thing in .profile works, since
   that is really what gives env's their special status.  you could
   just load and unload configs, and have the .profile thing load
   whatever is in ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS.  or, you can have the
   .profile thing load an env, and those become very special and it's
   impossible to unload something that is loaded in the config.

* or, you could have different states, where an env could mark
   something as must-load or could-load, and those would just update
   ALBION_LOADED_CONFIGS, or ALBION_TO_BE_LOADED, and then an unload
   could somehow override a could-loaded configs, somehow.  will have
   to think on that some more.

* eval or not eval:  some of the albion commands will output strings
   that need to be fed to eval, some of the albion commands will just
   print informational strings.  How to work this?  So far I'm just
   output non-evaled stuff to STDERR.  Another option is to output
   echo commands that are not a problem to eval.

* list commands will need to format output in nice columns when the
   list is long.

* bash completion for envs and configs
